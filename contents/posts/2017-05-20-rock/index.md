Let's Rock (stylized with single quotation marks) is the ninth studio album by American rock duo the Black Keys. It was released on June 28, 2019, through Easy Eye Sound/Nonesuch Records.[4]

It was their first release since Turn Blue (2014), marking the longest gap between studio albums in their career.

After collaborating with producer Danger Mouse for their previous four records, the duo decided to self-produce Let's Rock and to eschew keyboards in favor of a basic recording approach of guitar, drums, and vocals. Drummer Patrick Carney called the album "an homage to electric guitar".

Let's Rock was preceded by the singles "Lo/Hi", "Eagle Birds", and "Go".[5] "Lo/Hi" topped Billboard's Mainstream Rock, Adult Alternative Songs, Rock Airplay, and Alternative Songs charts in the US simultaneously, making it the first song ever to do so.[6]

Let's Rock received generally positive reviews, with many critics calling it a well-crafted if unoriginal album.
